# JSON 2 Artboards
## for Adobe Illustrator

Version: 0.5.0 (beta)

This is a simple script to turn a JSON object array into a multitude of artboards.

Currently everything is a bit hard coded. However option to choose a file, artboard size and naming convention will be added later.

Current settings are;
- Columns of 10
- Required to have "name" in json to name the artboard
- Hard coded json file.
- Size of the artboards is 80px x 80px ( perfect if making android icons. )
